The subject of this article contrasts two machine learning projects utilising similar
approaches. Supervised natural language preprocessing (NLP) for movie review
sentiment categorisation follows unsupervised financial fraud detection. Both
endeavours need data preparation, model deployment, and ethical evaluation,
underscoring the coherence of the data science methodology.
Unlabelled datasets are clustered to detect bank fraud. Principal component analysis
(PCA) maintains variance while reducing the dimensionality of high-dimensional data,
hence enhancing visual interpretation and computational efficiency. We categorise
transaction data by behaviour with K-Means clustering. Outliers are questionable
when they are far from cluster centroids. Transaction-to-Balance (TTB) ratios,
categorisation, and feature scaling facilitate clustering. Scores for elbow techniques
and silhouette enhanced cluster cohesiveness. Unsupervised learning may identify
genuine financial anomalies. In the second work, deep learning categorises IMDB
movie reviews as positive or negative. NLP starts with HTML cleaning, tokenisation,
stopwords elimination, and lemmatisation. The wording is rendered more standardised
and significant. Pre-trained Word2Vec vectors provide dense numerical embeddings
for words. The TensorFlow/Keras Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architecture
emulates temporal connections in natural language. The layer of dropouts mitigates
overfitting, and padded sequences preserve input dimensions throughout model
training and evaluation, using classification criteria such as accuracy, precision, recall,
and F1-Score. The accuracy of RNN sentiment categorisation is 69% notwithstanding
computational limitations.
Both prioritise privacy, fairness, vulnerability, and data integrity. Fraud detection
prioritises the anonymisation of financial datasets and the mitigation of bias, whereas
NLP highlights the responsibility of user-generated material and the explicability of
models. For ethical and successful machine learning, both methodologies emphasise
preprocessing. These examples demonstrate the capability of machine learning in
handling both tabular and unstructured text data. The study elucidates how
unsupervised and supervised artificial intelligence methodologies, dimensionality
reduction, clustering, and deep neural networks may address real-world data
difficulties.
